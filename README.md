Began Project: May 4th, 2019

Project Overview: A simple console guessing game that allows the user to pick a number between x number and tells the user if there guess is correct, too high, or too low.

Project Trello Board: https://trello.com/b/Iw078A7b/python-techdegree-project-1

Biggest challenge: Finding out how to get high score to work and display correctly.

How it can be improved: I think once I learn more about dictionaries the high score could be stored in it and given extra functionality
